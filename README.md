# Note-Manager
A basic task manager I'm working on in my free time. I'm trying to create a clean and expandable system. It currently has a list of notes its reading and you can switch between note boards and move notes and the note boards. You can click a button to have a dropdown show sub notes on a note, sub notes not currently rendered. My goal is to create a highly function note/task manager for personal use thats also open source. Much more is to come soon hopefully.

## Much more information bellow

 * Sub notes rendering
 * Different sorting modes for calander events

## Recently Updated
 * Changed colors
 * Added colorful buttons
 * Added circles around buttons when hovering over them
 * Fixed bug (under the Bugs header)
 * Added delta time to the button movement calculation

## Bugs
 * Theoretically all items to the side in a 2D grid of TextBoxContainer's will be shifted with the shift method
 * Fixed - when reording items with dropped menus the spacing would be thrown off (the wrong id/index was used, the origonal one instead of the shifted one was used)
 * No problematic bugs so far, knock on wood
