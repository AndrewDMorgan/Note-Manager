# Note-Manager
A basic task manager I'm working on in my free time. I'm trying to create a clean and expandable system that is highly functional. My goal is to create a fully functional task manager I can use in my daily life. I'm also wanting to improve my skills in making UI and create a nice, clean, understandable UI. I I may try to port it to android after completion but probably not.

## (Fairly Old Screenshot) Much more information bellow

## Current Features
 * General note view with boards, notes, and sub-notes
 * Dropdown menus on notes for sub notes
 * Adding sub-notes, notes, and note boards
 * Completion of notes, sub-notes, and note boards
 * Basic auto saving
 * Note reordering

## Planned Features
 * Calander/timed events
 * Catagories within note boards
 * Settings to customize the application
 * Saving and auto saving (sort of added but needs a lot of improvment for preformace)
 * Different sorting modes for calander events and the saving of the sorting in the main note boards
 * Different views, calander view, note view, ect... with different ordering/sorting options (similar to others)
 * Hopefully so many other features I haven't though of

## Recently Updated
 * Fixed a bug where notes would jump around when the application was laggy
 * Refactored things to redcude lag (not very noticable, text really is needing to be rendered and cashed)
 * Reduced unnecessary code (just a couple of lines)

## Bugs
 * When completed multiple tasks/boards the indexes get messed up. Half of the bug was fixed, the part relating to the held index
 * (Fixed) When dropping a bunch of sub-note menus, the notes begin jumping around when sliding to their new positions
 * No other problematic bugs so far, knock on wood
