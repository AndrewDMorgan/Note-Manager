# Note-Manager
A basic task manager I'm working on in my free time. I'm trying to create a clean and expandable system that is highly functional. My goal is to create a fully functional task manager I can use in my daily life. I'm also wanting to improve my skills in making UI and create a nice, clean, understandable UI. I I may try to port it to android after completion but probably not.

## (Old Screenshot) Much more information bellow

## Current Features
 * General note view with boards, notes, and sub-notes
 * Dropdown menus on notes for sub notes
 * Adding sub-notes, notes, and note boards
 * Graphical stuff
 * Completion of notes and sub-notes

## Planned Features
 * Calander/timed events
 * Catagories within note boards
 * Completing boards (working on rn)
 * Settings to customize the application
 * Saving and auto saving (sort of added but needs a lot of improvment for preformace)
 * Different sorting modes for calander events and the saving of the sorting in the main note boards
 * Different views, calander view, note view, ect... with different ordering/sorting options (similar to others)
 * Hopefully so many other features I haven't though of

## Recently Updated
 * Added functionality to the note and sub-note completion buttons
 * You can press escape to stop typing (when creating a note/sub-note/note board)

## Bugs
 * Fixed a sort of bug, now when all sub-notes are completed the dropdown menu will go back up
 * No problematic bugs so far, knock on wood
