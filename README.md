# Note-Manager
A basic task manager I'm working on in my free time. I'm trying to create a clean and expandable system that is highly functional. My goal is to create a fully functional task manager I can use in my daily life. I'm also wanting to improve my skills in making UI and create a nice, clean, understandable UI. I I may try to port it to android after completion but probably not.

## Much more information bellow

## Current Features
 * General note view with boards, notes, and sub-notes
 * Dropdown menus on notes for sub notes
 * Circles around buttons when hovering over them
 * Adding sub-notes & notes

## Planned Features
 * Calander/timed events
 * Catagories within note boards
 * Completing tasks
 * Settings to customize the application
 * Saving and auto saving
 * Different sorting modes for calander events
 * Different views, calander view, note view, ect... with different ordering/sorting options
 * Light mode theme and other settings
 * So many other features I haven't though of hopefully

## Recently Updated
  * Fixed Bugs

## Bugs
 * Fixed a bug where creating a note while sub-notes were dropped caused it to be created ontop of another box
 * Fixed a bug where the wrong variable was being set causing the typing cursor to be in a negitive position
 * Fixed a bug where only the rendered new-note button was moving when resizing the window
 * No problematic bugs so far, knock on wood
