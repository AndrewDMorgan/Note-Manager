# Note-Manager
A basic task manager I'm working on in my free time. I'm trying to create a clean expandable system. It currently has a list of notes its reading and you can switch between note boards and move notes and the note boards. Much more is to come.

## Current Features
 * Notes board veiwing and selecting
 * Note viewing
 * Note and note board reordering
 * Dark mode theme

## Planned Features
 * Calander/timed events
 * Catagories within note boards
 * Completing tasks
 * Adding notes and note boards
 * Settings to customize the application
 * Saving and auto saving
 * Add creation of sub-notes/descriptions
 * Add drop down menu for sub-notes (will move other elements in the collumn down)

## Bugs
 * So far no known bugs, knock on wood
