# Note-Manager
A basic task manager I'm working on in my free time. I'm trying to create a clean and expandable system. It currently has a list of notes its reading and you can switch between note boards and move notes and the note boards. You can click a button to have a dropdown show sub notes on a note, sub notes not currently rendered. My goal is to create a highly function note/task manager for personal use thats also open source. Much more is to come soon hopefully.

## Much more information bellow

## Current Features
 * Notes board veiwing and selecting

 * Note and note board reordering
 * Dark mode theme
 * Dropdown menus on notes for sub notes
 * Resizeable window

## Planned Features
 * Calander/timed events
 * Catagories within note boards
 * Completing tasks
 * Adding notes and note boards
 * Settings to customize the application
 * Saving and auto saving
 * Add creation of sub-notes/descriptions
 * Sub notes rendering
 * Different sorting modes for calander events
 * Different views, calander view, note view, ect... with different ordering/sorting options
 * Light mode theme
 * So many other features I haven't though of hopefully

## Bugs
 * Theoretically all items to the side in a 2D grid of TextBoxContainer's will be shifted with the shift method
 * No problematic bugs so far, knock on wood
