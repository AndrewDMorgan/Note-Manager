# Note-Manager
A task manager I'm working on. It currently has a list of notes its reading and you can switch between note boards and move notes and the note boards. Much more is to come.

## Planned Features
 * Calander/timed events
 * Catagories within note boards
 * Completing tasks
 * Adding notes and note boards
 * Settings to customize the application
 * Saving and auto saving
 * Add creation of sub-notes/descriptions
 * Add drop down menu for sub-notes (will move other elements in the collumn down)
